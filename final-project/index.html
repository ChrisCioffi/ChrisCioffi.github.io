                <p>
                The number of Medicaid patients who visit the dentist grew from 18 percent in 1997 to 50.1 percent in 2011, a change driven by several factors including the passage of the Affordable Care Act, an increase in the number dentists accepting Medicaid, and more school-based resources and case management. But in recent years, the growth has slowed.

                <p> Many children may not go to the dentist, but it would be hard to tell from a typical day at the University of Maryland School of Dentistry’s Baltimore clinic. The dental chairs are generally filled with children being examined by students and fellows.
                </p>
                <p>Nihkitah Jarrett’s 6-year-old son, Stanley Smith III, wiggled under bright white lights as second-year fellow Dr. Hojung Cho tried to fill a cavity in his left molar. Stanley, breathing deeply into a mask, got a little laughing gas to help him stay calm while Cho drilled his tooth.

              <p> Medicaid, which considers dental care an essential benefit for children but not adults, has brought more children to the dentist.
              </p>
              <p>Between 2009 and 2015, about a quarter-million more children in Maryland were enrolled in Medicaid dental care, but the percentage of children getting annual exams barely changed. </p>
              <p>“We’re maxing out,” said Dr. Norman Tinanoff a pediatric dentist and professor at the UMD School of Dentistry. </p>

            <div class="col-md-7 textbox_two">
              <p>Children don’t get to the dentist for several reasons, including a lack of transportation, or families seek medical care only if they are sick. </p>
              <p>
              “Part of that is due to the fact that their health care is based on acute problems, having pain, rather than annual visits,” he said. </p>
              <p>Some children get an annual medical exam because it’s offered at school, Tinanoff said. But dental exams are not mandated, he said.
              </p>
              <p>
              Those children only get their teeth checked when they start having problems.
              In 2015, more than 2,600 Maryland Medicaid patients suffering from a dental problem ended up in an emergency room. The data does not indicate whether the Medicaid patients were children or adults.</p>
              <p>Medicaid pays less than what private insurers do for dental care, and that means some dentists don’t accept the insurance. </p>

              <p>“They may eventually find a place like a community health care center or the University of Maryland Dental School that may take Medicaid, but they have to travel long distances,” Tinanoff said. “And that becomes a barrier for them to take care of it.” </p>
              <p>About a third of Maryland dentists accept Healthy Smiles, according to a 2016 Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene report.</p>
              <p>Maryland ranked No. 20 in the U.S. in 2012 for the number of children who got preventative dental care. That’s up four spots from 2007, according to data provided by the Annie E. Casey Foundation’s Kids Count project.</p>

              <p><b></br>Getting care</p></b>
              <p>To increase the number of children who get their teeth checked annually, county health clinics and non-profits have used mobile dental trucks and portable equipment to visit schools and offer checkups.</p>
              <p>Debony Hughes, the dental clinic manager at the Prince George’s County Health Department, said between 100 and 200 patients are seen each month at her clinic.
              The county’s dental truck, named for Deamonte Driver, also annually examines the teeth of about 1,500 children at schools with high percentages of low-income students.</p>
              <p>Prince George’s County and two non-profit groups visit some of the county’s schools to examine children’s teeth, treating them with fluoride and sealants —  a clear-plastic coating that covers children’s molars, making cavities less likely.</p>
              <p>In addition to the mobile unit, liaisons and nurses at county schools help parents navigate the system and get help for children suffering from toothaches.</p>
              <p>“We get a lot of our referrals through schools,” Hughes said. “A school nurse will call and tell us about a patient that is in pain and cannot sit in class, because they are in so much pain.”</p>
              <p>But even with the increased services, children still come into the clinic with advanced tooth decay, Hughes said. This is especially a problem for undocumented immigrant children who are not eligible for Medicaid benefits.</p>

            <p>Of all childhood diseases, tooth decay still ranks near the top.</p>
            <p>A 2015 U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found that about 18.6 percent of children aged 5-19 years had untreated cavities.</p>
            <p>While Kids Count data shows that about three-quarters of children have teeth deemed in excellent or very good condition, poor dental hygiene can lead to a host of other health problems later in life including gum disease and tooth decay.</p>
            <p>Jimenez said that as more children get on Medicaid, it’s important that they get annual exams and build good habits.</p>
            <p>At 21, patients lose access access to Medicaid benefits, she said. And then it’s up to them to decide whether they go back to the dentist.</p>
