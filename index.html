                             <p class="explainer">House lawmakers in spring sought to increase staffer pay by upping member allowances, but the early year optimism had faded among staffers by winter 2021.<br/> <strong>My take: </strong> I reached out to sources on whether they believed the allowance boost would improve staffer retention and pay.

I looked at the efforts and put them in historical context.</p>

                                 <strong>My take: </strong> I cleaned and analyzed FEC data using the programming language R. The story is a summary of my findings and original reporting on how some lawmakers drift away from small-dollar donations.

                                 I used an R library developed by the USGS to analyze data collected at area stream gauges. I also built two graphics: a GIF I created using QGIS and Photoshop, and another that I built using C3. I took all the photos too.

I researched area history in both city and N&O archives. I examined county and EPA records, and interviewed residents.</p>
