        <p>Germany won the World Cup by controlling the ball with more crisp passes than any other team in the tournament, taking more high percentage shots and scoring buckets of goals while keeping their opponents from finding the back of the net.</p>

        <p>German players were not selfish with the ball during the World Cup, and passed from teammate to teammate with ease. The team had more passes per game than any other team in the tournament.</p>
        <p>Germany was able to make accurate passes, and didn’t turn over the ball. While the Germans placed third overall with 82 percent of completed passes, the Germans were 7 percent above the average for teams in the tournament.</p>
        <p>The German team didn’t have the most shots per game, but when players decided to open fire, they made them count. The Germans took a near-average 14 shots per game, but 72 percent of the attempts were on-target — the highest in the tournament.</p>
        <p>Germany was able to score the most goals per game during the World Cup, and at the same time, kept opponent shots out of its net. The Germans scored a tournament-high 2.57 goals per game, and kept out almost a full point higher than the tournament average.</p>
        <p>The Germans didn’t rely on set piece plays on their path to victory. The team was able to yield 2.14 open play points per game, the highest in the tournament.</p>
        <p>The Germans were able to put balls on the frame from both long and short range. The team did not lead either category, but were near or above-average in shots from both inside and outside the area.</p>
